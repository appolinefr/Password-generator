# Password-generator

## Description 

This week's challenge was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.

The main acceptance criteria were as follow:
- be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- length of password at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- at least one character type should be selected
- the generated password is must match the selected criteria

This homework was overall not as challenging as expected as most of the content was covered during the classes. Deploying the page was a little overwhelming as this was not practised in class. Luckily the TA showed use the steps so it made this first hands-on experience smoother.
